# AutoElect
## Erielhonan's Automatic Election Engine

Within the Boy Scouts of America there is an honor society called The Order of the Arrow, often abbreviated as the OA.  Scouts become a member of the OA via a few steps:
1. Have attained a particular rank
2. Have camped a certain number of nights
3. Be voted worthy by a majority of scouts in their troop
4. Attend a specific weekend camping event

AutoElect automates most of this process, particularly by organizing the voting portion and sending out emails to certain administrators at certain times.  Often, scoutâ€™s information gets lost between steps 3 and 4, as several months or even years can pass between them.   AutoElect hears that data, listens, and remembers.
